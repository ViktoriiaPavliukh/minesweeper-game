Self-introduction
=================


Hello, everyone! My name is Viktoriia, and I'm a future Front-End developer. Today, I would like to share a bit about myself and why I decided to switch my career.

I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can shape our lives. During my maternity leave, I had several opportunities to start learning Front-End development, but something always seemed to hinder me â€” whether it was taking care of my little son, the challenges of the COVID, or a lack of self-confidence. However, everything changed in one day, back in February 2022. I purchased a Front-End development course and embarked on a journey to redirect my attention from mindlessly scrolling through news to focusing on something more productive.

In March of this year, I successfully graduated from that school. I have acquired skills in HTML5, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, BEM, Figma, Bootstrap/Material UI, React, Redux, and GIT/GitHub. Despite completing my studies, I still felt a need to enhance my confidence and deepen my knowledge. As a result, I decided to undertake additional tasks and challenges through the RSSchool.

Regarding my previous employment history, I worked as a Financial Controller at Spanish Telecommunication Company since 2013 to 2021. During my work there, I implemented and developed a system for automatic acceptance of invoices, as well as enhanced credit limit alert notifications. I also formulated and executed financial strategies that led to increased profitability and cost savings for the company. Additionally, I managed a team of financial professionals, providing them with guidance, support, and overseeing financial operations.

I hold a Master's degree in Management of SMEs from the University School of Management in France. Also, I obtained a Master's degree in Finance and Credit from Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics in Ukraine. 

Outside of programming, I have several hobbies and interests. I am passionate about traveling and planning trips, visited about 30 countries, and now me and  my son are living in United Kingdom, so it has taught me to be adaptable, open-minded, and resourceful. I also have a keen interest in cinematography and photography, appreciating the art of visual storytelling and how it can effectively convey complex stories and emotions through images and sound. Lastly, I enjoy learning foreign languages and engaging with people from diverse backgrounds.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I'm thrilled about the opportunities that lie ahead in my Front-End development career.
